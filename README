=== info ===

this is what it sounds like. it is seven basic logic gates in python that respond with ```true``` which is equivilant to 1 or ```False``` which is equivilant to 0


=== TODO ===

if I feel like it I might make registers and stuff but that seems hard and I have a bunch of stuff to do with school

=== how to use === 

    * add stuff to the ```example.py``` file
    * execute the file
    * NOTE: DO NOT DELETE THE PARSE FUNCTION IN THE ```gates.py``` OR THE IMPORT IN ```exampl.py```
    * use python 3 btw
